# What is 'use strict' and what does it do?
+ makes debugging easier
+ it's string, not keyword, for browser compatibility


## How to turn it on?
+ globally or inside a function

## what's the point and why use it?
+ you can't use a variable without first declearing it with var
+ stop you from useing reserve words that are  in future js version
+ you can't delete function and variables
+ you can't delete function arguments
+ makes eval safer
```
var theVal = 0;
thVal = 1;

if(theVal>0){
  console.log('hello');
}
```

```
'use strict'
var let = 0;

```


```
'use strict'
var foo = 1;
delete foo;

```





```
'use strict';
var a = 2;
eval('var a =1');
console.log(a);

```
