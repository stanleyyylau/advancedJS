# Pass by value or reference?
primitive types are passed by value, objects are reference

## what is pass by value?
the changes you make doenst effect outer scope, only inside that function

## passed by referecce
we can't chagne what it points to, only change the properties on it
+ reference can be broken

```
'use strict';
var a = {'moo':'too'};
function foo(a){
  a = {'too':'moo'}
}
foo(a);
console.log(a);

```
